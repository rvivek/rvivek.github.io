Based on what I have studied, interacted and worked with, here’s a distillation of traits I have admired about great leaders, in no particular order. I intend this to be an evolving list. 

* Leaders maintain a high talent density. They hold a high bar during recruiting and aggressively let go of low performers. They are willing to live with the pain of an empty seat over a mediocre hire

* Leaders typically violate at least one of the standard management axioms

* Leaders are clear on the final destination of where they want to go. The exact route may evolve on the way

* Leaders can oscillate between operating at the vision and the lowest tactical level as the situation demands

* Leaders are not conflict-averse. They have hard conversations quickly. The longer it lingers, the worse it gets 

* Leaders raise the bar for their peer orgs as much as they do for their own[^1]

* Leaders use a combination of data and gut to make decisions. They know one without the other isn’t sufficient 

* Leaders build and refine systems continuously. They are never done. Success isn’t just the outcomes. The success is in the system that produces the outcomes[^2] 

* Leaders think from first principles. They know every company & market is different and know what is transferable from their past vs not. They seek truth 

* Leaders are decisive and consider the whole picture. Everyone views the world differently. It’s up to the leader to seek to understand the varying points of view (PoV) and reconcile them into a decision. Sometimes you can’t reconcile PoVs and that’s okay. They still make a decision based on their knowledge and get the team to commit to it

* Leaders raise the ceiling vs the floor. It’s one thing to say this is the minimum bar, it’s another thing to say, THIS is the bar we all need to operate in. Leaders often do the latter.

* Leaders are comfortable operating in ambiguity. They know perfect data is a myth

* Leaders are energy-givers 

* Leaders care... about everything. Almost maniacal 


[^1]: If you are a CEO, the equivalent is peer companies. For example, Elon Musk raised the bar for the entire automotive industry, not just Tesla.
[^2]: A counterpoint here: https://www.shyamsankar.com/p/there-is-no-process-it-will-be-painful It’s not completely a counter, as process != system but there are some overlapping concepts
