A startup&#8217;s first two hires.

Once you raise money, the default action is usually to hire more programmers to build fast and experiment more. Unfortunately things won&#8217;t move in the pace you expected it to. A lot of things fall into your plate &#8211; setting up insurance, payroll, a small kitchen, visiting the bank for a company credit card, buying computer peripherals & accessories for employees, decorating office space & many more. This leaves very little time to think about product & hiring and hence slowness sets in.

The first hire to make is an **office manager.** It might seem steep to hire one when you&#8217;re in very early stages (3-5 people team) but it&#8217;s totally worth it! You can try part-time and see how much your life improves as a founder. Operational work in a startup is a disaster and time killer. And if you&#8217;re on a growth spree, it&#8217;s best to consider a COO. One of the very early hires for Square was Keith Rabois as a COO so that Jack could focus on the product. Vinod Khosla (one of our investors) keeps saying this &#8211; &#8220;*Any time the founder *<em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel">doesn&#8217;t spend on product or hiring is not worth it&#8221; </em></em>and is absolutely true.

The second hire to make is a **founder&#8217;s coach. **National & international basketball teams have a coach. The best tennis player talks about how [impactful a coach has been][1], the best cricket [player gets a coach][2] but not an entrepreneur.  Why? We mask under the term *advisor *but usually an advisor or a board member is a top CEO who has very little time for herself. An incubator/accelerator can help you guide only so much and is not realistic for them to spend focused time with you after you &#8220;*graduate*&#8220;. It&#8217;s the same case with VC&#8217;s. Their time is limited and would like to get just an overview or the health of the company and not every single detail. They&#8217;re always there for advice but can never be your coach.

I got to know that this role does exist in the startup ecosystem  when [John Hering][3] mentioned about Kevin Hartz being a &#8220;coach&#8221; than an advisor. I later met [Mark Jung][4]. We met once in 2 weeks, then once a week and then twice a week before I felt guilty of using his time and made a formal proposal. He has been incredibly helpful in shaping the company and me as a better entrepreneur. Some of the things which are tough to do as a young first-time entrepreneur.

  * <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How do you hire for a VP, sales role when you&#8217;ve never been there?</em>
  * <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">What&#8217;re the metrics you&#8217;ve to be focused on? and how to improve them?</em>
  * <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How do you handle when an employee complaints about something gone wrong and you don&#8217;t know how to fix?</em>
  * *How do you manage/split time as a founder?*
  * *What are the parameters to consider to decide the compensation & equity options for X?*

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">and many more.. </span>

Sure, you can learn everything by trial & error. But a coach uses his experience of building companies to guide you faster. It&#8217;s very hard to get a coach who&#8217;s willing to put in the time to your company but worth every bit to build a much bigger company.
