My mind often wanders when I visualize. I am trying out a new technique and Iâ€™m calling it, The Photoalbum. Imagine in the distant future where you are browsing through a photobook explaining the significance of each of the pictures to your progeny or explicitly reading what is written below each picture. The pictures depict what you want to become and the words underneath them is the story or behind the scenes. 

The visualization exercise now becomes a silent conversation and is much more focused.
